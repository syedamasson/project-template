# [Your Project Name]

This project uses a structured design system and layout architecture for building consistent, maintainable front-end experiences.

## Overview

This project includes:

- A complete **design system** with tokens, utility classes, and components — shipping neutral defaults, with dark mode built in
- A **brand theme** (`assets/css/theme.css`) for per-project visual identity (fonts, colours, logo)
- Clear **layout and spacing rules** for consistent page structure
- Documented **best practices** for CSS, JavaScript, and HTML

## Getting Started

### With Claude Code (recommended)

Open the project in Claude Code and say:

> Set up this project

Claude follows the onboarding flow in `CLAUDE.md`: it runs `npm install` to sync the design system, interviews you to fill in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`, propagates your project name across the template, applies any known brand tokens to `assets/css/theme.css`, and regenerates the docs site.

### Manual setup

1. Run `npm install` — this syncs the design system CSS from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` package into `assets/css/design-system.css`
2. Review `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for project goals and requirements
3. Follow the [Setup guide](docs/site/setup.html) to customize brand colors, fonts, and logo
4. Explore the [Documentation](docs/site/index.html) for template and project guides
5. Browse the canonical design system docs at [bydefault.design](https://bydefault.design/design-system/what-is-a-design-system.html)
6. Check the [Brand Book](docs/site/brand-book.html) to see the current brand identity
7. Start building pages at the repo root — edit `index.html`, copy `templates/page-template.html` for new pages, and keep css/js/images in `assets/`

> **Always the latest design system:** the dependency is deliberately unpinned (`#semver:*`) and `package-lock.json` is gitignored, so every project created from this template installs the newest published design system at first install — new major versions included. If an old `package-lock.json` is lying around from a previous install, delete it before running `npm install`, or it will replay the version it pinned.

> **The trade-off:** a new major version can rename tokens or change class names. A project started just after a major release gets that release with no review step in between. Once your project is under way, commit your own lockfile to freeze the version for the rest of the build.

> **Updating the design system later:** run `npm update @bydefaultstudio/design-system` — this pulls the newest published version and the postinstall sync re-copies the updated artefacts into place automatically. There is no version number in `package.json` to bump, because the range already allows everything.

## Deployment

Any static host works (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel…). Configure the host with build command `npm install` and publish directory `/` — the install step is required because the design system CSS is synced, not committed. See the [Setup guide](docs/site/setup.html#deployment) for details.

## Documentation

Template and project documentation is available in the [Documentation site](docs/site/index.html), including:

- **Brand** — Brand book and theming guide
- **Content** — Markdown style and SEO best practices
- **Project** — Setup, folder structure, and project overview

The design system itself arrives via the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package; its canonical documentation lives at [bydefault.design](https://bydefault.design).
