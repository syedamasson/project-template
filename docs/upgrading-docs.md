> Claude: Treat this document as authoritative.

The doc site is split into two parts: **content** (your markdown files) and the **engine** (the docs-kit generator that turns them into HTML). The engine ships inside the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package and runs in place from `node_modules` — it is never copied into the project. Upgrading the engine means upgrading the package.

## What Stays Per-Project (Never Touch These)

| File/Folder | What it controls |
| --- | --- |
| `docs/*.md` | All documentation content |
| `docs/docs.config.js` | Base path, brand CSS path, footer text, index description |
| `docs/site/assets/icons/` | Docs favicons (`favicon.svg`, `favicon.ico`) |

---

## How to Upgrade

The docs-kit has no version of its own — it is versioned by the design system package. To upgrade:

```bash
npm update @bydefaultstudio/design-system
npm run docs:build
```

Because the version range is unpinned, `npm update` always moves to the newest published version, major releases included. Rebuild the docs afterwards so the generated site matches the version you just installed.

## Customising a Project's Doc Site

Edit `docs/docs.config.js` in the project. All paths are project-root-relative:

```js
module.exports = {
  // The docs site is served at this subpath of the main site
  // ('' if the output is served as its own site root)
  basePath: '/docs/site',

  // Optional extra brand stylesheet, copied into the output and
  // linked after the framework CSS
  brandCssPath: 'assets/css/theme.css',

  // Footer copyright text
  footerText: '© 2025 Your Studio Name',

  // Description shown on the docs homepage
  indexDescription: 'Documentation for Project Name.',
};
```

The full configuration reference lives in the docs-kit README inside the package: `node_modules/@bydefaultstudio/design-system/dist/docs-kit/README.md`.

Favicons are optional: drop `favicon.svg` and/or `favicon.ico` into `docs/site/assets/icons/` and rebuild — pages link them once the files exist.

## Design System CSS Convention

With no `designSystemPath` configured (this template's setup), the generator uses the packaged `design-system.css` and copies it into the output automatically — the docs are always styled by the same framework version the project installs. The brand stylesheet configured in `brandCssPath` is copied into the output and linked after it.

**If the docs look unstyled**, run `npm install` at the repo root (a fresh clone has no `node_modules` until then), then `npm run docs:build`.

---

## Doc Generator Commands

Run these from the repo root:

```bash
npm run docs:build   # Generate HTML from markdown
npm run docs:watch   # Auto-regenerate on markdown changes
```

## When to Update the Template First

Engine improvements happen in the design-system repo (the docs-kit ships with the package). Template-side there is no version to keep current: the dependency is unpinned (`#semver:*`), so every fresh install takes the newest published package. Improve project docs content here; improve the engine upstream.
