This template provides a solid foundation for new projects. Follow these steps to customize it for your project.

## Install

Run `npm install` at the repo root before anything else. This syncs the design system CSS from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package into `assets/css/design-system.css` — the file is gitignored and does not exist until the sync runs. Canonical design system documentation lives at [bydefault.design](https://bydefault.design).

The dependency is unpinned, so this install always pulls the newest published design system, major versions included. If a `package-lock.json` exists from an earlier install, delete it first or it will replay the version it pinned. Check what you actually got:

```bash
node -p "require('./node_modules/@bydefaultstudio/design-system/package.json').version"
```

## Brand Colors

Update brand colours in `assets/css/theme.css`.

The design system (`assets/css/design-system.css`) ships neutral working defaults — system font stacks and a neutral accent. Your brand overrides the §1/§2 primitives in `theme.css`; the semantic layer cascades through them automatically.

**What to change** — uncomment and edit the starter blocks in `theme.css`:
- `--text-accent` — your brand accent; drives `--text-link` and `--input-focus`
- `--text-primary` / `--background-primary` — core text and background, if the neutral defaults don't suit
- `--status-*` — status colours (optional)

**Example:**
```css
/* assets/css/theme.css */
:root {
  --text-accent: #3485cd;
  --text-primary: var(--neutral-800);
  --background-primary: var(--white);
}
```

**Note:** You never need to edit `assets/css/design-system.css` for brand colours. Override primitives; semantics resolve through them.

---

## Fonts

Update font families in `assets/css/theme.css`:
- `--font-primary` — your primary font family
- `--font-secondary` — your secondary font family (if used)
- `--font-tertiary` — your monospace font (if used)

Fonts load via `theme.css` too: self-host with `@font-face` (font files in `assets/fonts/`) or `@import` a Google Fonts URL at the top of the file. No per-page font links are needed.

---

## Brand Theming

### Stylesheet load order

Every page loads the three CSS layers in this order:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/design-system.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/theme.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/style.css">
```

1. `design-system.css` — the framework: tokens, base styles, utilities, components. Never edited per project.
2. `theme.css` — your brand: primitive overrides and font loading. Ships as an all-commented starter.
3. `style.css` — project-specific styles built on top of the system.

`theme.css` must load **after** `design-system.css` so brand overrides win via the cascade — no `!important` needed.

### What theme.css should override

- **Do** override §1/§2 primitives: fonts, `--text-accent`, neutrals, status colours.
- **Don't** restate semantic tokens (`--text-*`, `--background-*`, `--border-*`) unless you are deliberately re-skinning a semantic role — the semantic layer already resolves through the primitives you set.

### Dark mode

Dark-mode brand overrides live in two blocks in `theme.css`:

- `[data-theme="dark"]` — applies when the toggle (`assets/js/theme-toggle.js`) sets the attribute on `<html>`
- `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { :root:not([data-theme]) { … } }` — the no-JS / OS-preference fallback

**Warning:** the two blocks must mirror each other exactly. Drift between them is a known failure mode — any value added to one must be added verbatim to the other.

---

## Logo

Replace the logo image:
- `assets/images/logo.svg` — the project logo, referenced by pages and the brand book

Favicons live in `assets/icons/` and are referenced in each page's `<head>`. The docs site keeps its own favicon copies in `docs/site/assets/icons/`.

---

## Project Brief

Fill in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` with your project details:
- Replace all bracketed placeholders `[like this]` with actual content
- Define project goals, audience, and constraints

---

## Meta Tags & SEO

Site pages carry their own SEO meta tags — `templates/page-template.html` includes the full set (see the [SEO guide](seo-best-practices.html)). The docs site's page titles and descriptions come from each markdown file's frontmatter.

---

## Documentation

The documentation is ready to use, but you may want to:
- Review and customize documentation content in `docs/` folder
- Update `footerText` and `indexDescription` in `docs/docs.config.js`
- Add or remove documentation pages as needed

---

## Deployment

The site is static — any static host works. One requirement is non-negotiable: **the host must run `npm install` as its build step**. `assets/css/design-system.css` is gitignored and only exists after the postinstall sync, so a deploy that skips the install ships every page unstyled.

Configure your host with:

- **Build command:** `npm install`
- **Output / publish directory:** `/` (the repo root)

On Cloudflare Pages these are set under **Settings → Builds & deployments**. Other hosts (Netlify, Vercel) have equivalent settings. GitHub Pages has no build step by default and would need a small Actions workflow to run the install first.

This pairs with Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`): when a new design system version is released, Dependabot opens a PR; merging it triggers a redeploy, and the install pulls the new version.

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Run `npm install` (syncs the design system CSS)
- [ ] Update brand colours in `assets/css/theme.css`
- [ ] Update font families in `assets/css/theme.css` (plus `@font-face` or `@import`)
- [ ] Mirror any dark-mode overrides in both dark blocks of `theme.css`
- [ ] Replace logo in `assets/images/logo.svg`
- [ ] Replace favicons in `assets/icons/`
- [ ] Fill in `PROJECT_BRIEF.md`
- [ ] Review and customize documentation

## Next Steps

1. Start building at the repo root — `index.html` is the starter page; CSS, JS, fonts, and images live in `assets/`
2. Use the templates in `templates/` folder for new pages and components
3. Follow the coding standards in the documentation
4. Keep documentation updated as you build
