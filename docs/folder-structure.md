This document defines where files live and why.

Do not add new top-level folders without updating this file.

## Structure

```
index.html              → Starter page (replace with project homepage)
CLAUDE.md               → Claude Code development rules (authoritative)
README.md               → Project overview and getting started
PROJECT-BRIEF.md        → Project brief and requirements
PROJECT-PROGRESS.md     → Progress tracker for ongoing work
package.json            → npm manifest: design system dependency + postinstall sync
scripts/
  sync-design-system.js → Copies the design system CSS from node_modules into assets/css
.github/
  dependabot.yml        → Weekly checks for new design system versions
assets/
  css/
    design-system.css   → Design system framework — synced from the
                          @bydefaultstudio/design-system npm package on
                          npm install; gitignored, never hand-edited
    theme.css           → Brand overrides (primitives, fonts)
    style.css           → Project-specific styles
  js/
    theme-toggle.js     → Dark-mode toggle
  fonts/                → Self-hosted web fonts
  icons/                → Favicons and app icons
  images/               → General images and Open Graph images
templates/              → Page and component boilerplate
docs/                   → Documentation (markdown sources + generated site)
```

`node_modules/` and `package-lock.json` are gitignored. The lockfile is deliberately not committed and the design system dependency is unpinned (`#semver:*`), so new projects always resolve the newest published design system at first install, major versions included. Projects should commit their own lockfile once under way, to freeze that version for the rest of the build.

## assets/css/

The three-layer CSS contract. Load order matters — every page links them in this sequence:

1. `design-system.css` — the framework: tokens, base styles, layout primitives, utilities, components. Synced from the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package on `npm install` — never edit it; changes belong upstream in the design-system repo. Ships neutral working defaults.
2. `theme.css` — your brand: overrides §1/§2 primitives (fonts, `--text-accent`, neutrals) and loads brand fonts via `@font-face` or `@import`. Semantics cascade through the primitives.
3. `style.css` — project-specific styles built on top of the system.

## assets/js/

- `theme-toggle.js` — dark-mode toggle: sets `data-theme` on `<html>`, persists to localStorage, defaults to the OS preference, and injects icons into `.dark-mode-toggle` buttons.

## assets/fonts/

Self-hosted web font files, referenced by `@font-face` declarations in `theme.css`.

## assets/icons/

Favicons and app icons (`favicon.svg`, `favicon.ico`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, …). Referenced directly in each page's `<head>`; treated as brand assets, not part of the design system.

## assets/images/

General image assets and Open Graph images.

## templates/

Boilerplate for new files:

- `page-template.html` → HTML page template (correct stylesheet order, SEO meta tags)
- `component-template.css` → CSS component template
- `component-template.js` → JavaScript component template

## docs/

- Markdown documentation files (the sources — edit these)
- `docs.config.js` → Project-specific doc settings (base path, brand CSS path, footer, description)
- `site/` → Generated HTML documentation — **never hand-edit**; regenerate with `npm run docs:build`
  - `assets/icons/` → Docs favicons — preserved across rebuilds
  - `assets/docs-kit/` → Engine CSS and scripts, copied in by the generator on every build

The docs site engine (docs-kit) ships inside the `@bydefaultstudio/design-system` npm package and runs from `node_modules` — there is no vendored generator to maintain. The generator bundles the packaged framework CSS into the output and copies `theme.css` in after it, so docs pages render live brand values. Built for serving at the `/docs/site` subpath of the main site (`basePath` in `docs.config.js`).

## Notes

Empty folders are tracked using `.gitkeep` to preserve structure in the template.
